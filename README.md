I took data from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lylebegbie/international-rugby-union-results-from-18712022/), which gives me data for all the rugby union matches from 1871-2023.

In this project, I look to predict the results of the 2024 Guinness Six Nations tournament. In addition, I also look to answer some questions:
1. Is there such a thing as "home advantage"?
2. How important is "momentum"?

I plan to use a Random Forest model as that makes the interpretation easy of the results. I am looking to first predict the score differences between each team.
